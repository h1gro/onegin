To entertain the sad,
Not doing even step aside,
To sigh outloud, think along:
My uncle was a man of virture,
His only heir, verte and weak.
To serve around, make his bed,
He had the fun, I had the sore,
To sit by bedplace day and night,
When he became quite old and sick,
And what a cheep and cunning thing
But grecious goodness! what a bore!
To fetch the pills, to mourn and grim,
`God damn old man, why ain't you gone?'
He sought respect and tried to teach me,
