My uncle was a man of virture,

When he became quite old and sick,

He sought respect and tried to teach me,

His only heir, verte and weak.

He had the fun, I had the sore,

But grecious goodness! what a bore!

To sit by bedplace day and night,

Not doing even step aside,

And what a cheep and cunning thing

To entertain the sad,

To serve around, make his bed,

To fetch the pills, to mourn and grim,

To sigh outloud, think along:

`God damn old man, why ain't you gone?'
